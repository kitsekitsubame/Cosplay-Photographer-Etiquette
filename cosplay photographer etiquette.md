\# Cosplay Photographer Etiquette

\### 1. Ask for Permission Before Taking Photos

\- Never take a photo of a cosplayer without their consent. Approach politely and compliment them on their costume or character choice.

\### 2. Respect Personal Space

\- Don't get too close or make the cosplayer uncomfortable. Maintain a reasonable distance while taking photos.

\### 3. Ask Before Posing Them

\- If you want the cosplayer to pose in a specific way, ask politely. Never touch the cosplayer without their permission.

\### 4. Avoid Taking Photos in Inappropriate Places

\- Don't take photos in private areas, such as resting zones, bathrooms, or while the cosplayer is eating.

\### 5. Respect Privacy

\- If the cosplayer prefers not to have their photo shared, respect their request. If you plan to post the photo on social media, inform them and give proper credit.

\### 6. Avoid Negative Criticism

\- If you have opinions about the costume or cosplay, refrain from making negative or harsh comments. Respect their effort and creativity.

\### 7. Be Mindful of Time

\- Don't take too long with the photoshoot, as the cosplayer may want to enjoy the event or interact with others. Allow them time to rest and mingle.

\### 8. Respect Professional Arrangements

\- If the cosplayer has a professional arrangement with another photographer, respect that business relationship and avoid disrupting them.
